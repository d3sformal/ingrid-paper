\section{Future Work}

In the future, we would like to add support for generating other aspects of MPS languages and to increase the level of automation.
Our primary research goal is to investigate the usage of automated (machine) learning for the purpose of generating editors that support nice and readable code layout.
First, we would have to collect a set of input source code files to be used for training. This step might involve a user study designed in order to identify examples of layout that a majority considers as nice and readable.
The information about code layout, once it is available, will be then leveraged and used also to improve TextGen.
Another subject for future work is automated construction of parser-based tools that could be used for translating source code in plain-text to instances of MPS languages.
